# Introduction

For this project, we will run an A/B test run on the data of an e-commerce website.  Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new landing page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# A/B Test:
If we want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5% we can state our hypothesis in terms of p_old and p_new which are the converted rates for the old and new pages.Conversion means completing a desired action like buying items or clicking through the rest of the website.

# Results
the calculated p-value = 0.9002 which is bigger than alpha (type 1 error rate) so there is not significant evidence that the new page generates more traffic.
